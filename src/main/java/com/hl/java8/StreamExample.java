/**
 * The first programming concept that "Java 8 in action" introduces as
 * part of the new features that java 8 has implemented is "stream processing"
 * via the Streams API [java.util.stream]
 *
 * Streams API methods can be chained to form complex pipelines to process data.
 * The pipeline of Stream operations can be run in parallel, without the need of
 * using Threads, on several CPU cores on disjoint parts of the input.
